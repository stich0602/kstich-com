				<p>Liberation is a Windows Phone 7 RTS game that is also an entrant in the Microsoft Imagine Cup. The goal of the Imagine Cup is to solve world problems with technology. Liberation is inspired by the recent events in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and other nations who are trying their hardest to overthrow oppressive governments.</p>
				<p>In Liberation you play as the guide of a peaceful revolution in a fictional country, promoting equality and the founding of basic human rights for the betterment of your country. This game will help people learn that sometimes revolution needs to happen and, if it does have to, that it is best to be peaceful and promote the welfare of all people.</p>
				<p>I am lead programmer on the project and we are working in C# with the XNA framework. I developed the foundations for rendering and gameplay systems, as well as much of the gameplay and displays themselves.</p>
