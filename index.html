					My name is Kevin Stich and I'm a software developer.  I work primarily in PHP, but also know C#, C++ and Java.  Programming became my passion early on when tweaking my favorite PC games to play in a way that I felt was more fun.  I had my first true programming classes in high school.  From then on, programming is what I've seen myself doing for the rest of my life, be it in games or applications.
				</p> 
				<p> 
					Right now, I am a Senior at <a href="http://www.depaul.edu/index.asp">DePaul University</a>.  I will earn my B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Game Programming in June of 2011.  I also work for <a href="http://synapse-games.com">Synapse Games</a>, writing server code for our various social games.  I used to work for the school, maintaining and updating the labs associated with the Game Development Degrees.  I have also worked as an undergradute research assistant to Joe Linhoff in the Game Development degree working on tests and enhancements for his QE gaming engine (C/C++ and OpenGL) and on the book on how to develop with it.  I see myself as a leader, a hard worker and I can excel in teams or independently.
				</p> 
				<p> 
					When I'm not in school or working, I enjoy being together with friends and family.  I enjoy games of all kinds, photography and music in my few hours of spare time.
