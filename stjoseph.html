				<p>
					For my Computer Science capstone class, my team was tasked with creating a full website solution for the St. Joseph Services community organization. We were responsible for all project planning and documentation.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the lead developer, I was responsible for the creation of the theme for our Wordpress installation. I worked with PHP in dealing with the Wordpress system and plugins, as well as Javascript, CSS and HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					St. Joseph Services was founded in 2001 by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul to serve the needs of the poor in the city of Chicago. Seeking guidance from the office of Cardinal George, they serve families and individuals at risk in Chicago’s Humboldt Park/West Town and Austin communities.
